        My name is Salah Eddine but my friends call me Salah. Before knowing me, people always think I'm too serious, but in reality I'm really
        <b>easygoing</b> and sometimes I can be <b>funny</b> or kinda silly XD. I am a <b> Data Scientist</b> and I love what I do. In my free time I usually play chess, watch a show/anime or hang out with friends. </p>
